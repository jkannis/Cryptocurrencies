# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
This project processes a cryptocurrency dataset to produce visualizations for use in evaluating new investment possibilities.

- First the data was preprocessed for PCA by removing records with null values and only including currencies that are being traded and have been mined.
- Then the data dimensions were reduced using PCA.
- Next, K-Means was used to cluster the cryptocurrencies.
- Finally, visualizations were created to include 2D and 3D scatter plots.
